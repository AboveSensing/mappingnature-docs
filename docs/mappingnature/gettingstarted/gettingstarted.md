#Getting Started with Mapping Nature

Above Sensing's main photogrammetry tool is Mapping Nature. As explained in the [Overview](../mappingnature.md), Mapping Nature
 is capable of creating various products derived from drone imagery. In this section of Above Docs, we will explore the various 
tools available in Mapping Nature. Through the tutorial in the next page, you will learn the basics of Mapping Nature, including 
accessing existing data processed by the Above Sensing Team, as well as creating your own processing. We will also explore the 
Plant Health tool currently available for testing.
