# Tutorial 1: Using Mapping Nature

If you are an Above Sensing client, the most likely way that we will share data with you is through links
to processed data in Mapping Nature. In order to do that, a general understanding of the layout and tools available is needed. Section 1 
deals with a general overview, while Section 2 provides a quick introduction on how to process your own images.

##Section 1
### Step 1: Logging in

Go to [Mapping Nature](https://mappingnature.ca), and in the home page you will be asked to provide your Username and Password. 
An Above Sensing Team member will provide you with log in info for accessing data for your organization.

### Step 2: Viewing the processed dta your project
The short video below illustrates how easy it is for Above Sensing's clients to access and view processed data. The video
provides a quick overview of the various tools available in the map view, including seeing image positions, exporting results,
changing the basemap, and taking measurements. Other tools such as contour creation and addition of geospatial files, such as geojson or shapefiles, 
will be covered in Section 2.




### Step 3: Viewing multispectral indeces
This section is meant for Above Sensing clients interested in plant health of the areas mapped. Mapping Nature provides 
a variety of plant health focused indexes which can provide an insight into plant health. This feature is experimental and 
dependant on various variables such as camera used, camera calibration, sun exposure, and others. The results from these 
images should be interpreted with caution, and a review by an expert in remote sensing and plants is recommended. The view below
quickly demonstrates how to use the plant health view in the map.

### Step1: Creating a new project

### Step 2: Uploading Images and Processing settings

### Step 3: Have a coffee, or two, depending on the number of images
