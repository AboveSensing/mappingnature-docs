# What is Mapping Nature?
Mapping Nature is a photogrammetry platform used for the processing of images captured from a drone. This software was 
adapted from the open source software [Open Drone Map](https://opendronemap.org/).

# What can Mapping Nature do?
Mapping Nature is a versatile online photogrammetry software that provides Above Sensing's clients the ability to either 
create or access processed data in the form of 3D models, orthomosaics, and point clouds. Further tools for plant health,
topographic lines, and automatic classification of features is currently being developed by the Above Sensing Team.

Mapping Nature can use images collected with a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) that are either multispectral or regular color pictures.
With these images, a processed called Structure from Motion is used for area reconstructions and orthomosaics. 

This documentation is meant for clients of Above Sensing that are currently testing the first iterations of Mapping Nature.
We hope that the following tutorials will provide you with the ability to access existing processed data and process your own.
